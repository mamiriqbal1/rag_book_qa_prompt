A Sensors are used in both monitoring and control applications. There is a  subtle difference between how these two methods work (the flowchart is a simplification of the process):Monitoring of  a patient in a hospital for vital signs such as heart rate, temperature,  etc.Monitoring of intruders in a burglar alarm systemChecking the temperature levels in a car engineMonitoring pollution levels in a river.Turning street lights on at night and turning them off again during daylightControlling the temperature in a central heating/air conditioning systemChemical process control (for example, maintaining temperature and pH of process) the temperature reading < pre-set value, then a signal is sent …… to an actuator (via a DAC) to open the gas valve to the heater… to an actuator (via a DAC) to turn on the water pumpthe process continues until the central heating is switched off. A certain chemical process only works if the temperature is above 70°C and the pH (acidity) level is less than 3.5. Sensors are used as part of the control system. A heater is used to heat the reactor and valves are used to add acid when necessary to maintain the acidity. The following description shows how the sensors and computer are used to control this process:temperature and pH sensors  read data from the chemical processthis data is converted to digital using an ADC and is then sent to the computerthe computer compares the incoming data printer management when printing out a document:–  first of all, the printer driver is located and loaded into memory – then the data is sent to a printer buffer ready for printing – if the printer is busy (or the printing job has a low priority) then the data is sent to a printer queue before it can be sent to the printer buffer –  it will send various control commands to the printer throughout the printing process –  it receives and handles err or mess ages and interrupts from the printer. You will notice from Figure 4.1 that there are two types of software: system  software and application software: set of programs to control and manage the operation of computer hardware provides a platform on which other software can run  required to allow hardware and software to run without problems provides a human computer interface (HCI) controls the allocation and usage of hardware resources. used to perform various applications (apps) on a computer allows a user to perform specific tasks using the computer’s resources may be a single program (for example, NotePad) or a suite of programs (for  example, Microsoft Office) user can execute the software as and when they require.\n",
